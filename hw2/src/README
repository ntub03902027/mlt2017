1. The file "prob11.py", despite its name, it's the code for both question 11 and 12. So are "prob13.py" (for Q13-14), and "prob15.py" (for Q15-16)
2. Please use python 2.7, but not python 3.x to execute the codes
3. The directory "data/" and "libsvm/" must be included to correctly execute the program. Moreover, it's neccessary that the python package "numpy" is properly installed.
