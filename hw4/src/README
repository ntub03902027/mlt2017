1. The file "prob12.py", is the source code for problems "Experiments with Random Forest" (Questions 12-16), and is the only source code in this homework.
2. Please use python 2.7, but not python 3.x to execute the codes
3. The directory "data/" and must be included to correctly execute the program.

4. Since constructing 30000 trees takes time, and the outputs are loooooooong, if you just want to output results of some of the questions, please follow the following usage:
	
	python2 prob12.py [problems to process]

For instance:

	python2 prob12.py 12-14,16

will print the results of problems 12, 13, 14 and 16. If no problems are specified (i.e. len(sys.argv) == 1 ), by default, the program will print results of all problems. Note that all the following commands are invalid:

	python2 prob12.py 12, 13, 15	      (no spaces between them)
	python2 prob12.py 11,13,14			  (the problems should be between 12 and 16)
	python2 prob12.py 14-12				  (must be "12-14")
	python2 prob12.py 12,14,			  (redundant comma)
	python2 prob12.py prob12,question16	  (numbers only, no strings with non-number and comma)
	python2 prob12.py 12,13 sdlkjhvbsjk	  (redundant arguments)
